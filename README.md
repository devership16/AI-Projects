# AI-Projects
Projects to implement basic AI concepts like Basic Search Functions, Game Playing Bot, FOL Inference Engine

1. First Order Logic Inference Engine: 
    Agent to implement first-order logic inference engine using resolution and unification algorithms.
    
    •   Parsing of the logical statement in CNF form and creating a knowledge base.

    •	Applying unification algorithm to clauses in the knowledge base to resolve the query to determine entailment.
    
    Programming Language: Python

2. Minimax Game Playing Agent:
   A Minimax game playing agent which uses alpha-beta pruning to search for varying depths of moves to find an optimal next move for the user.
    
    Programming Language: Python 
    
3. Animal Placement in a Nursery: Extension of N – Queens:
   Implementation of global search strategies like Depth First Search, Breadth First Search and Simulated Annealing to place K animals in a N * N nursery with obstructions.
   
   Programming Language: CPP

4. Collegiate Football Predictions:
    A Neural-Net model to predict football winning bets using tensor flow and Numpy.  
    
    •   Utils functions: To determine the best network architecture and parameters to get an optimal MSE. 
   
   Programming Language: Python

5. Built a Part-of-Speech Tagger for machine translation of English(89.94% accuracy), Hindi(92.41% accuracy), and Chinese (86.55% accuracy) languages.
    
    • Developed a Hidden Markov Model for estimating the transition and emission probabilities.
 
    • Viterbi Decoding to generate the most likely sequence of tags for word sentences.
   
   Programming Language: Python
