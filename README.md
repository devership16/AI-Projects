# AI-Projects
Projects to implement basic AI concepts like Basic Search Functions, Game Playing Bot, FOL Inference Engine

1. First Order Logic Inference Engine: 
    Agent to implement first-order logic inference engine using resolution and unification algorithms.
    •   Parsing of the logical statement in CNF form and creating a knowledge base.
    
    •	Applying unification algorithm to clauses in the knowledge base to resolve the query to determine entailment.
    
    Programming Language: Python

2. Minimax Game Playing Agent:
   A Minimax game playing agent which uses alpha-beta pruning to search for varying depths of moves to find an optimal next move for the user.
    
    Programming Language: Python 
    
3. Animal Placement in a Nursery: Extension of N – Queens:
   Implementation of global search strategies like Depth First Search, Breadth First Search and Simulated Annealing to place K animals in a N * N nursery with obstructions.
   
   Programming Language: CPP
