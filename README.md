# AI-Projects
Projects to implement various Machine Learning algorithms.

1. Perceptron Classifier for Hotel Reviews:
    Implemented a perceptron-based classifier (Vanilla Perceptron and Averaged Perceptron) for classifying hotel reviews(taken from TripAdvisor, Expedia).
    
    • Vanilla Perceptron: Achieved a mean F1 score of Pos F1: 0.92 Neg F1: 0.92(Sentiment of reviews) and True F1: 0.86 Fake F1: 0.86 (Validity of Hotel reviews). Mean F1 score: 0.8874
    
    • Averaged Perceptron: Achieved a mean F1 score of Pos F1: 0.92 Neg F1: 0.92(Sentiment of reviews) and True F1: 0.87 Fake F1: 0.88 (Validity of Hotel reviews). Mean F1 score: 0.8968
    
    Programming Language: Python

2. Naive Bayes Classifier for Hotel Reviews:
    Implemented a Naive Bayes classifier to classify Hotel reviews (taken from TripAdvisor, Expedia) based on two categories:
    
    • The validity of the hotel reviews: True/Fake
    
    • The sentiment of the hotel reviews: Pos/Neg
    
    Achieved a mean F1 score of Pos F1=0.94, Neg F1=0.94, True F1=0.88, Fake F1=0.89, Mean F1 = 0.9124

    Programming Language: Python
    
3. Collegiate Football Predictions:
    A Neural-Net model to predict football winning bets using tensor flow and Numpy.  
    
    •   Utils functions: To determine the best network architecture and parameters to get an optimal MSE. 
   
   Programming Language: Python

4. First Order Logic Inference Engine: 
    Agent to implement first-order logic inference engine using resolution and unification algorithms.
    
    •   Parsing of the logical statement in CNF form and creating a knowledge base.

    •	Applying unification algorithm to clauses in the knowledge base to resolve the query to determine entailment.
    
    Programming Language: Python

5. Minimax Game Playing Agent:
   A Minimax game playing agent which uses alpha-beta pruning to search for varying depths of moves to find an optimal next move for the user.
    
    Programming Language: Python 
    
6. Built a Part-of-Speech Tagger for machine translation of English(89.94% accuracy), Hindi(92.41% accuracy), and Chinese (86.55% accuracy) languages.
    
    • Developed a Hidden Markov Model for estimating the transition and emission probabilities.
 
    • Viterbi Decoding to generate the most likely sequence of tags for word sentences.
   
   Programming Language: Python
   
7. Animal Placement in a Nursery: Extension of N – Queens:
   Implementation of global search strategies like Depth First Search, Breadth First Search and Simulated Annealing to place K animals in a N * N nursery with obstructions.
   
   Programming Language: CPP
