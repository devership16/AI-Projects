First Order Logic Inference Engine
Agent to implement first-order logic inference engine using resolution and unification algorithms.
•	Parsing of the logical statement in CNF form and creating a knowledge base.
•	Applying unification algorithm to clauses in the knowledge base to resolve the query to determine entailment.
